# Telco_Churn_Classification_Project
Classification models Project on Telco customer churn data

This project focuses on finding the best machine learnning classification model to predict  whether or not a customer will churn. This will be done by analyzing a dataset regarding Telco Customer Churn. </br>This Dataset contains information from a fictional telco company that provided home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. 
</br>Dataset:  [dataset](churn.xlsx)
